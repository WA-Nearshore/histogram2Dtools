# README Histogram2D Tools

This repository contains four ArcGIS Pro script tools.  

The purpose of these script tools is to enable interactive investigation of the spectral properties of multi-band imagery. The user can create a 2-dimensional spectral frequency histogram from two specified bands of an image. The user can also delineate polygon AOIs within the image and locate the associated pixels on the histogram. Likewise, polygon AOIs within the histogram can be associated with pixels in the image.

This is a beta release of these script tools as there are significant known issues that are described below.
